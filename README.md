**AirBnB clone - The console**

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project is the first step toward building a fully functional web application inspired by AirBnB.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a command-line interpreter that manages AirBnB objects. This command interpreter serves as the foundation for future project modules, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.
